It was Sunday and Mark was cleaning up his room as it was also cleaning day. Suddenly something in a small dusty desk
caught his eye. He picked it up and he dusted it. It was his graduation photo album from 10 years ago.
He started thinking about his college days and realised he barely kept in touch with any of his college friends anymore. He decided that he wanted to try to meet all of them to catch up.
He made phone calls to most of his college friends, but he found that the phone numbers of most of them had changed and some of his friends even did not remember him. The interesting thing is that when he tried to connect one friend, who is male, a woman's voice showed up. 
He was immediately spooked, as what he had expected to be his very old dear collee
ge friend, was now a woman. She had the surgery in july apparently. Mark was convv
inced and he made an appointment for august.
